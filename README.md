# odin-recipes2
This is my second run through of The Odin Project's recipes project. Most of the
projects will have "part 2's" because I had to take a break from doing work on 
The Odin Project (TOP), but wanted to go back through material as a refresher.
This time around I am going to take things a little slower to soak up the avail-
able knowledge as efficiently as possible. I also want to take things slower
this time to prevent myself from getting discouraged when I get toward the end
of the Javascript portion of Foundations. 

Here we go!
